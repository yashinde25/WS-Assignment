				I plan to look for a intership in relation to my major of Data analytics to gain some experience 
				in the IT sector. Which may help me gain a job in the future after I graduate.
				To make the most of both my degrees and my passion for technlogy. In the long run I want to
				make a difference in the world, and make it a better place.</br>
				<br>I would like to work towards getting into roles such as: </br>
				<ul class="Future_job">
					<li>Data Analyst</li>
					<li>Business Analyst</li>
					<li>Consultant</li>
					<li>Risk Analyst</li>
				</ul>
				
				I particularly want to work in the Data sector, as I believe that there is much scope in 
				the sector in the future. Technology is rapidly advancing and ever evolving. Simultaneously
				the amount of data that is required to be processed is exponentially increasing as well.
