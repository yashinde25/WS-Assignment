				<h4> Structure of Webpages:</h4>
					<p> While websites may vary in how they look and their Aesthetics. The fundamental structure of 
						a website is usually identical or similar. They all consist divisions that seperate the various content
						and parts of a website. The three main divs are the header, body and footer.
						<ol>
							
							<li><span class="order_list">head </span></li>
							<br>The header is the first section in a html document and is located at the top of the website.
								It typically contains the logo and name of the brand or organisation the website it for or any important information
								the organisation may want visitors to see first. For this website the header primary contains the name of the website
								and the link of the selected webpage. <div></div>
								
							<br>
							<li><span class="order_list">body</span></li>
							<img src="HTML_structure.jpg" alt="HTML page structure" id = "HTML_structure"/> 
							<br>The body holds a majority of the content of the website and influences the overall perception of the website.
								Here a variety of items can be conjunction providing visitors with information in a pleasing manner.
								Items such as text, tables, videos, audio, etc. can be found in variety of permutations and combinations to build 
								a website to the specifications of the owner. The body for this site contains a combination of the items found in 
								the <i class = "bold">common tags and what they do</i> table. <div></div>
								
							<br>
							<li><span class="order_list">footer</span></li>
							<br>The footer is located at the bottom of the website and html document. The footer's primary use-case
								is to provide information in relation the owners of the website. This typically includes items such as 
								copyright information, contact information, link back to the top and sitemaps. For this site, the
								footer has the name of the author and his University. Additionally, it also has links to access the other Webpages
								within the website. <div></div>
							<br>
							<li><span class="order_list">CSS</span></li>
							<br>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used in conjuction with the the html files. The primary use of the CCS file
								is to help in styling and positioning the various items within the html files. There are a number of ways that
								CSS can be implements. For this site specifically, external CSS was implemented in order to keep the files organised.
								<br><br> Below it a summary of the various items with in the <span class="diff_font"> websystem.css</span>

			<h3> Aesthetics</h3>
			<h4> Inspiration </h4>
				<p>The underlying principle for the design for this website was minimalism, perfectly presented by architech 
					<a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe">'Ludwig Mies van der Roh'</a> when he said
					 <span class="diff_font">"Less is more"</span>. This is primarily due to my belief that there is something elegant in simple design.  
					 The wesbite has a black background to elevate the similplicity of the website and help focus on the content. Additional colours are
					 utilised in a way to provide "pops" of colour to appeal to users and seperate the content into its various sections. Tables and images 
					 have also been used to supplement or complement text where approporiate to provide a more streamlined experience. 
					 As too much text will lead to the website feeling clunky and heavy.
				</p>
				<h4> Interactivity </h4>
				<p> Interactive elements have been added to the website to provide a more immersive experience for the users.
					This can be primarily be seen in the navigation bar when you hover over the buttons. Each button you hover over will 
					change colour to indiciate that it can be selected. Once selected the block will change colour (grey) and the text will
					also change colour (orange) to indicate it has been selected. This is also the case with the link to the architect in
					the <span class = "bold"> Inspiration</span> section and <span class = "bold"> Accessiblity</span> section. This is very 
					beneficial to people with vision difficulties as smaller indications of selections may not be as obvious to user. 
				</p>

			<h3> Accessiblity</h3>
			<p> This website has been made to the specificatons of the 
				<a class="links" href="https://canvas.uts.edu.au/courses/20159/pages/webass-specification?module_item_id=631839">UTS WebAss Specifications</a> 
				and the Accessiblity guidelines of the <a class="links" href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility">W3 Web Accessiblity Initiative.</a>
				This enables this website to cater to the need of individuals who have accessibility requirements. 
			</p>
			<img src="Font-sizing.jpg" alt="Code showing the dynamic font size so it changes when zoom changes." id = "font_sizing"/>
			<h4> Font style and sizing </h4>
			<p>The standard sans serif font has been used for this website as it is considered to be the the conventional standard for websites.
				San serif is a clean font that is not very harsh on individuals who have difficulty reading. This has been used with
				high-contrast colours to provide a enjoyable reading experience. For font sizing, rather than setting it to a specific number. It has 
				been set to a percentage so the size of the font dynamically changes when the website it zoomed into (as shown in image to right). To maintain the overall 
				structure of the website and to provide users a better reading experience.
			</p>
			<h4> Colour selection and contrast </h4>
			<p> A black background was used for design significance and also to contrast the white text. This enables individuals to read
				with ease as there is no clashing any colours that makes the content difficult to read. Colours from the same or close family
				have been used to seperate the difference sections of the content, to provide a better user experience without adding much bulk.
				Menu selections also change colour to contrast with the backgound to indicate it can be selected. This is very beneficial to people with 
				vision difficulties as smaller indications of selections may not be as obvious to user. 
			</p>
			<h4> Screenreaders</h4>
			<p> The structure of the website has been based of the guidelines provided. Each heading, and its content has been 
				labelled correctly in order for users using screenreaders will be able to navigate the website with ease
				(ie. < h1>, < p>, < th>). All images also have alt texts for users using screen reader or when images are not working.
